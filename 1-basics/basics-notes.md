## Big O

As your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?

### Simple mental models

'count the loops'

- O(1) ->

  - hashmaps?
  - accessing array at array[index]

- O(n) -> for loop over length of 1d array

  - drop constants
  - 2n, n - x, etc

- O(n^x) -> nested for loops..
- O(n log(n)) -> quicksort
- O(log(n)) -> binary search trees\

## Array

A simple, contiguous memory space.

JS... heh
